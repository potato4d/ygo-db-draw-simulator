## About this tool

This is an extension to the official Yu-Gi-Oh database that allows you to add the "Tame 5 Draw" function.

Even if you are calculating the probability, you cannot know the sensory value and detailed movement until you actually draw. You can use the draw simulation to help you make adjustments.

## Installation

You can install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yu-gi-oh-official-databas/ejjpkjcmmdbhadaanbpfonfobfkopedi).

Click on the link above and click "Add to Chrome" to install it. Once the installation is complete, the extension will be automatically activated.
